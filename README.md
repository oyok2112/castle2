CASTLE ADVENTURE II
-------------------

This is the sequel to the 1995 DSWare Flagship title, "Castle Adventure".

Castle Adventure II takes the original and completely scraps it.  Key differences:

```
              Original            Sequel
              --------            ------
language      qbasic              c++
genre         text adventure      indie text-adventure/rogue-esque hybrid
dev year      1994-1996           2025-2026
```

So you can see it's a bit different there.  More to come as development is in 
the prototype/POC phase.
